# Netlify Full Project Deployment Plan

## Challenges

1. **React Build Issues**: The current React codebase has import conflicts causing build failures
2. **Backend Architecture**: Need to convert Express backend to Netlify Functions
3. **Database Access**: Ensure Netlify Functions can access the database
4. **Environment Variables**: Configure environment variables for the Netlify deployment

## Solution Strategy

### Step 1: Fix Frontend Build

1. Use Vite's experimental `legacy.buildSsrCjsExternalHeuristics` option to handle modules better
2. Create a script to temporarily normalize React imports
3. Set proper environment variables for the build

### Step 2: Serverless Backend

1. Map all Express routes to Netlify Functions
2. Create a single entry point that can parse and redirect requests
3. Include database connection and storage logic

### Step 3: Database Configuration

1. Ensure all environment variables for database access are set in Netlify
2. Create database initialization code for cold starts

### Step 4: Deploy with CI/CD

1. Set up GitHub Actions or Netlify CI for continuous deployment
2. Create proper build commands for the integrated solution

## Implementation Plan

1. Fix the React build issues by creating a temporary build environment
2. Create adapter functions to map Express routes to Netlify Functions
3. Set up proper redirects and routing
4. Deploy and test incrementally
